# ü§ì Project Overview

This Study Resource Recommender System helps users find books, courses, videos, and notes based on selected subject, difficulty, and resource type. It first searches a curated local dataset, then falls back to live Google Custom Search API, Coursera, and Internshala APIs if no exact match is found locally.

The app is designed to be user-friendly with features like saving favorites, recent searches, and exporting recommendations.


# ‚ö°‚ö° Features
Filter by Subject, Difficulty, and Resource Type: Select from a growing list of subjects including AI, Deep Learning, Cloud Computing, and more.

Local Dataset Recommendations: Fast and relevant suggestions from curated CSV data.

Live Web Search Fallback: If no local match, fetch live results from Google Custom Search, Coursera, and Internshala.

Trending Topics: Display popular current courses and topics with direct links.

Save Favorites: Add resources to favorites and export as CSV or JSON.

Recent Searches: Automatically track and show recent user searches.

Light/Dark Mode: Comfortable reading modes toggle.

Download Recommendations: Export your recommended resources for offline use.
